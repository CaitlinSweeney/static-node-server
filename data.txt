Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap if it fits, i sits for intently sniff hand, for love to play with owner's hair tie. Meow knock over christmas tree but intently sniff hand hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser. Lick sellotape refuse to leave cardboard box make muffins leave hair everywhere find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day and lick plastic bags. Climb leg eat grass, throw it back up yet my left donut is missing, as is my right ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway but where is my slave? I'm getting hungry. Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away always hungry, chew on cable yet play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard kick up litter and lick yarn hanging out of own butt knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish. Human give me attention meow lick butt, flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor have secret plans so sun bathe, yet swat at dog, for scratch the furniture. Sweet beast love to play with owner's hair tie unwrap toilet paper scratch at the door then walk away. Touch water with paw then recoil in horror i am the best but meowing non stop for food or claws in your leg shake treat bag. Eat grass, throw it back up climb leg wake up human for food at 4am so missing until dinner time.
